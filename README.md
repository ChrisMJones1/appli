### Personal Contributions
This unfinished build is of a team project I am currently working on. My main contributions to the project include:

* All the Data Visualization routes and components
* Added the Pagination functionality and components/routes to the Job Application section
* Created and maintained and supported other teammates in regards to the MongoDB Atlas Cluster due to my additional experience in MongoDB from completing all of the MongoDB University online courses
* All of the complex Aggregation queries in the server routing in the backend folders
* Implemented the UserId tracking in the sessionStorage to act as an additional foreign key, allowing the JWT to act as the access auth
* Styling and logic/routes for all previously mentioned features
